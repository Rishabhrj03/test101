Here's a professional version of the README file:
Company Rating & Review Application

This application allows users to rate and review companies. It consists of both frontend and backend components, which need to be set up and run separately.
Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js (with npm)
    MongoDB (or access to a MongoDB instance)

Setting Up the Frontend

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

    bash

cd frontend

Install the necessary dependencies:

bash

npm install

Start the frontend server:

bash

    npm start

    The frontend will typically be served on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Setting Up the Backend

    Navigate to the backend directory:

    bash

cd backend

Install the required dependencies:

bash

npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following environment variables:

bash

PORT=4000
MONGO_URL='your MongoDB URL'

    Replace 'your MongoDB URL' with your actual MongoDB connection string.

Start the backend server:

bash

    npm start

    The backend will typically run on http://localhost:4000 by default.

Notes

    Ensure that both the frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for the application to function correctly.
    The frontend will communicate with the backend via the specified PORT.
